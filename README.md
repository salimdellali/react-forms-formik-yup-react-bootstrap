# Building React Forms with Formik, Yup and React-Bootstrap

Live Demo [Here](https://react-forms-formik-yup-react-bootstrap.netlify.app/)

This is an example on how to use formik, yup and react-bootstrap all together with react, this form handles all error edge cases.

Submitting this form won't actually send any information. It's going to display the information entered in an alert window after 1 sec delay (to simulate real world form submission).
